### Objective 
Our goal with this project is to gain insights on Data Science jobs through Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) and visualization techniques.
### Project Team:  
Kris Skorna, Simon Ponce, Donovan Watson, Geoff Maitland 
### About The Data

- ‘experience_level’- Experience level of employee (Entry,Mid,Senior,Executive)

### Topics Explored:
- What company size is the most common? What experience level is more common?
- What are the Data Jobs salary (on average)?
- What is the breakdown of experience levels across all data jobs? How does this change over time?
- What experience level will provide the best salary (on average)
- What are the top ten data jobs based on number of job titles by experience level? 
- What is the most common work environment (office, remote, or hybrid)?
- Are there trends over time with work_setting?
- How do salary averages compare for top three jobs over time? (2020-2024)
- Are there trends with the top three jobs between 2020 and 2024?
- Based on trends for top ten jobs, can a prediction be made for job growth beyond 2024?

### Conclusions: 
- Senior positions are more in-demand than other experience levels. It appears that companies are looking for candidates with more experience than some who are first starting in this field.
- Growth in the top three roles (Data Scientist, Data Engineer, Data Analyst) saw a moderate increase in 2021, followed by significant increases in 2022 before peaking at the beginning of 2023
- In-person work continues to hold its ground- our data reveals an unexpectedly high prevalence of traditional work setups. So, it seems the office isn’t going extinct just yet!
